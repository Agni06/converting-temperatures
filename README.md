Project: Console-Based Temperature Converter

Description:
Developed a Java application for converting temperatures between Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin scales, with a console-based interface.

Key Contributions:

Designed and implemented the core temperature conversion logic to accurately convert temperatures between different scales, ensuring precision and reliability.
Utilized object-oriented programming principles to create modular and maintainable code, with classes for handling temperature conversions and user interaction.
Implemented a console-based interface for user interaction, providing a simple and straightforward means for input and output.
Added error handling to gracefully manage invalid input and ensure the robustness of the application.
Conducted testing to validate the accuracy of temperature conversions and verify the functionality of the application under various scenarios.
Technologies/Concepts Used:

Java programming language
Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles
Command-line interface (CLI) development
Mathematical formulas for temperature conversion
